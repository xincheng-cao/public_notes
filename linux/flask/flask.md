flask application 

global flask instance

application factory:  function

any configuration, registration, and other setup the application needs will happen inside the function, then the application will be returned.

Create the flaskr directory and add the __init__.py file. The __init__.py serves double duty: it will contain the application factory, and it tells Python that the flaskr directory should be treated as a package.
